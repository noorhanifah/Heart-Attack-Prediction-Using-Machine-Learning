# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deployed Using Streamlit
 
## Project Description
 According to World Health Organisation (WHO), every year around 17.9 million deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) predisposing CVD becoming the leading cause of death globally. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels, if left untreated it may cause heart attack. Heart attack occurs due to the presence of obstruction of blood flow into the heart. The presence of blockage may be due to the accumulation of fat, cholesterol, and other substances. Despite treatment has improved over the years and most CVD’s pathophysiology have been elucidated, heart attack can still be fatal.

 Thus, clinicians believe that prevention of heart attack is always better than curing it. After many years of research, scientists and clinicians discovered that, the probability of one’s getting heart attack can be determined by analysing the patient’s age, gender, exercise induced angina, number of major vessels, chest pain indication, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, and maximum heart rate achieved.

The objective of this project is to predict the possibility of one getting heart disease
customer subcription of the marketed product in order to determine effectiveness of the campaign. Data collected contains details that could determine the possibily of the customer to subscribe to their product as well as to improve marketing strategy.

## Running the Project
This model run using Python programming and the libraries available.

## Project Insight
To achieve the objective of this project, deep learning approach using TensorFlow consedering the amount of dataset available. The deep learning model consist of Input, Dense, Dropout, and Batch Normalization layers with 128 epochs and patience of 10. Training loss and accuracy are also displayed using TensorBoard. The targeted accuracy for this model is 70% and more.

## Accuracy
After cleaning, selecting the best features and training the data, this model can achive up to 70% accuracy. 
Below are some of the result given by the model after training. However, result might slightly different when run multiple times.
